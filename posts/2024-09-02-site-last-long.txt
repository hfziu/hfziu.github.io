# Building a site to last long

[People die][1], but what happens to the digital content they create?

I have another homepage with my own domain [xfzhao.com](https://www.xfzhao.com),
but domains expire. If I pass away, I can't expect anyone to renew the domain
for me, and the content will soon become inaccessible on the Internet. So, I'll
move some content to GitHub Pages, publishing under the github.io domain,
assuming it will [last longer][2] than my own.

The layout of this site is inspired by [elly.town](https://elly.town). All posts
are written in plain text. Although some Markdown conventions are used, I'm not
using a Markdown parser to render these `.txt` files.
